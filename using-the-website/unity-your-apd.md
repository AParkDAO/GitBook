## Reading the info



1. **APY** tells you the annualised rate of return based on the reward yield. It takes into account the effect of compounding, since uAPD rebases exponentially.
2. **TVL** measures the dollar amount of all the Unity APD in ApeParkDAO.
3. **Current Index** allows you to track your gain from Unity. If you Unity at genesis (epoch 0) and never cancel Unity any APD, your balance today would be X times greater, where X is the current index. You can use the index to track your position by marking down the index number when you Unity and Cancel. You divide the index number when you cancel Unity by the index number when you Unity to get the ratio by which your APD balance has increased.
4. **Your Balance** tells you how many cancel Unity APD are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can Unity.
5. **Your Unity Balance** tells you how many Unity APD are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can cancel Unity.
6. **Next Rebase** tells you the remaining time until the next rebase.
7. **Reward Yield** tells you how much your APD balance will increase when the next epoch begins. For example, if you Unity 100 APD and the upcoming rebase is 0.5427%, your APD balance would increase from 100 to 100.5427.
8. **ROI (5-Day Rate)** estimates how much your APD balance will increase after 5 days, if the reward yield stays the same during this period. For example, if you Unity 100 APD and the rate is 8.4577%, your APD balance would increase from 100 to 108.4577 after 5 days.
