# Purchase A Bargain

Bargain allow users to buy APD from the protocol at a discount by trading it with i) liquidity (LP tokens) or ii) other assets. The former is called Liquidity Bargain and the latter Reserve Bargain. Bargain take roughly 15 epochs to vest, and APD tokens are vested linearly to the user over that period. Liquidity Bargain help the protocol to accumulate and lock liquidity, while Reserve Bargain allow the protocol to grow its Cave, and thus its RFV faster.

ApeParkDAO offers two types of Bargains on its website: USDT and APD-USDT LP Bargain.

## One-click transaction

For both types of Bargains, it is a one-click transaction as the user is required to own one kind of asset only. For example, the user provides USDT to purchase APD-USDT LP Bargain. The system will automatically trade at a ratio of 50:50 to form an LP to purchase Bargains.

## How to Redeem

1. Go to the Bargain page of the ApeParkDAO website and select the Bargain type you have purchased.
