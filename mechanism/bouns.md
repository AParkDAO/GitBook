## What is Bouns?



Bonus is as an extra allowance. ApeParkDAO uses the Bonus mechanism to stimulate buying sentiment in the market, and increase and activate potential users who buy Bargain while acquiring liquidity and other reserve assets. A portion of SellFee will go into the Bonus Pool contract. If the Bonus Pool reaches 10,000 USDT, the contract will draw 1 reward from the last 10 addresses that purchased Bargain with more than 1,000 USDT, and the reward amount is 1,000 USDT. The conditions for participating in the Bonus lottery are as follows: addresses that purchase Bargain with an amount of more than 1,000 USDT can participate in the lottery. If there are less than 10 addresses that purchase Bargain with an amount of more than 1000USDT, the Bonus distribution will be cancelled for this round, and the SellFee will enter the Cave to supply the operating funds of ApeParkDAO.
