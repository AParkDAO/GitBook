## What is Doughnut?



ApeParkDAO seeks to encourage long-term investment and more new users to participate in projects. Up to 15% of the recommended rewards are awarded when users recommend more users. The award is attributed linearly to the introducer within 14 days. Doughnut is a reference revenue incentive system included in the agreement that rewards users who have worked hard to promote projects. (For Bargain purchases only, not DEX purchases.)
