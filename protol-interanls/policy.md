# Policy

APD features policy constants that allow us to optimize the system.

## Bargain

The BCV allows us to scale the rate at which Bargain premiums increase. A higher BCV means a lower discount for Bargain purchasers and more protocol profit. A lower BCV means a higher discount for Bargain purchasers and less protocol profit. The vesting term determines how long it takes for Bargains to become fully redeemable. A longer term means lower inflation and lower Bargain demand.

## Sale

The DCV allows us to scale protocol buy pressure up or down. A higher DCV means more buy pressure and higher deflation. A lower DCV means less buy pressure and a weaker floor.



## Cave

Profit Allocations are the only Cave variable. This allows us to choose who receives from the protocol.

## Unity

There are no variables in the Unity contract. APD and uAPD are always redeemable 1:1, and profits are always distributed equally through rebase.
