## What is the ApeParkDAO?

![](<.gitbook/assets/Youtube Banner.jpg>)

ApeParkDAO is building an unprecedented Metavese ecosystem. With GameFi + NFT as the core, it builds the underlying economic base for the game on the platform, provides credible transaction certificates. The ApeParkDAO project attracts top experts in the fields of gaming, finance, blockchain, etc. Their project experience and research results are the cornerstones of the success of this project, injecting strong technical genes into the platform. We can not only help traditional game manufacturers to transform and upgrade to Web3.0, but also provide a variety of services as professional on-chain service generation operations and traffic support to realize the full value of the chain game ecosystem.

## How does ApeParkDAO work in the DeFi world?

ApeParkDAO has reformed and innovated on the basis of the traditional GameFi launchpad. With decentralized finance as the core, it incorporates the savings token value-added agreement created by the Web3.0 trading scenario. The savings token value-added agreement is a new six-in-one technology application, which consists of Unity、Bargain、SellFee、Doughnut、Enforce Rich（ER）、Bonus.

The characteristics and benefits of the agreement are:

* Liquidity is controlled by the protocol itself.
* Unity can obtain APD tokens, which can increase the gains from the rise of tokens, and stabilize the losses from the fall of the currency price at the same time.
* Cave assets can be used for platform services and start-up project investment to share the benefits with all participants.
* Bargain is the second strategy for maximizing project revenue. Through the Bargain mechanism, tokens can be purchased at a discounted price.
* Encourage long-term holding, collect SellFee from paper hands, and reward diamond hands.
* The Doughnut mechanism encourages more new users to participate in the project, and users can get high referral rewards when they recommend other users.
* The ER mechanism suppresses the potential double selling pressure, which caused by buying Bargain at a high discount and obtaining high referral rewards at the same time.
* Stimulate market sentiment, encourage large purchases, and randomly get Bonus rewards.

## **What is the point of APD?**

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behaviour of the APD token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimise for stability and consistency, so that APD can function as an economic base and exchange voucher. In the short term, We hope to provide a credible savings scenario for all participants to promote asset preservation and appreciation.

## How **do I participate in ApeParkDAO?**

There are two main strategies for market participants: Unity和Bargain。More APD tokens can be obtained through Unity, and Bargain can be exchanged for discounted APD tokens after a fixed vesting period.

Governance participants can get involved on our dApp (Coming soon) and through discussions on our community discord. We are always looking for new community members to contribute！

## **How can i benefit from ApeParkDAO?**

The protocol mints new APD tokens from the Cave, most of which are distributed to Unity participants. Thus, the gain for Unity participants will come from auto-compounding balances, though APD exposure remains an important consideration. If the increase in the number of APD tokens exceeds the decrease in the price of APD, Unity will profit. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in APD (due to inflation), Unity would make a profit.

Bargain commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in APD and thus the Bargain's profit would depend on APD price when the Bargain matures. Bargain benefit from a rising or static APD price. Selling will also affect the price of APD, thereby affecting Bargain's income.

## Who created ApeParkDAO?

ApeParkDAO was ideated and built by a distributed pseudo-anonymous team, and is contributed by the community.

## Who runs ApeParkDAO?

No one. ApeParkDAO is DAO-governed. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by token holders through voting.
