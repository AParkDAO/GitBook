# Cave

The Cave contract is a simple vault implementation holding all the funds collected by the protocol. If, for instance, a user purchases a APD-USDT LP Bargain, the Bargain APD-USDT LP is fully taken in by the Cave in return of the market equivalent of APD Bargain for. New APD will be minted based on the RFV of the Cave assets.
