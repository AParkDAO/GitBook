# Bargain

All Bargain contracts are more or less the same, with the one exception of the assets or LP tokens they manage. The Bargain contracts handle all deposits and redmptions. Here parameters for monetary policy are configured. Such parameters are for instance the BCV and the max indicidual payout.
